Today Was the Second Day In The Journey Of Web DEV.

Concepts of CSS.

Notes : 

Types Of CSS - Inline , Internal , External 
    --> Inline - Goes with the Html Tags (Not Recommended)
    --> Internal - In HTML-Document CSS (Recommended for small Webpages)
    --> External - ".CSS" file is linked to Html

CSS Selectors:
    To Style a Html tag in CSS we select the element
    -- eg. for <div> element "div{}" in CSS.

    To style Html element through Class we select ".class-name"
    -- eg. for <div "class=container"> element ".container{}" in CSS.

    To style Html element through ID we select "#ID-name"
    -- eg. for <div "ID=container"> element "#container{}" in CSS.
    ** Multiple Elements can have same class but every element has unique ID

    To style Direct child Html element of an element we select "parent element > child element"
    -- eg. for "<div><p></p><div>" element "div > p" in CSS.

    To style descendent Html element of an element we select "parent element descendent element"
    -- eg. for "<div><span><p></p></span><div>" element "div p" in CSS.

CSS cascade Algorithm -- about Specificity and priority of styling in CSS
    1. Cascade: Many selector are used to style a single element and CSS solve this conflict by Cascade.
    2. Cascade Algorithm : It determine which property of CSS will be applied in Element. The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.
    3. Position and order of appearance : If same selector, then last one will be used
    4. Origin: authored CSS has priority
    5. Important: When !important It has highest priority. 
    6. Specificity: Selector with high specificity is applied to html element.
    7. Order of Specificity: Inline Style > ID selector > Class or Attribute  selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector
    8. Calculating Specificity: Value of Each Selector: Universal is 0, 1 for each element selector or pseudo-element, 10 for each class value (or pseudo-class or attribute selector), 100 for each ID value. Inline Style has 1000 specificity. Just add value to find specificity.
